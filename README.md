**Aura** is a lightweight, simplified HTTP client for Python, inspired by Drizzle. Aura's minimal and clean API makes it easy to handle HTTP requests with fewer lines of code, focusing on simplicity and readability.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Fluent API** for concise GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
- **Custom Headers**: Easily set global headers or request-specific headers.
- **Flexible Query Parameters and JSON Support**: Handle query parameters and JSON payloads directly.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in basic error handling for streamlined usage.
- **Lightweight and Fast**: No unnecessary bloat; just what you need to get the job done.

## ðŸŽ‰ Getting Started

Import and initialize the client by specifying the base URL for your API.

```python
from Aura import AuraClient

# Initialize the client with a base URL
client = AuraClient(base_url="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com")

# Set default headers (optional)
client.set_default_headers({"Accept": "application/json"})
```

Fetches posts for a specific user.

```python
response = client.get("/posts", params={"userId": 1})
print("GET Response:", response)
```

#### ðŸ”¹ POST with JSON Data
Creates a new post with a title, body, and user ID.
```python
response = client.post("/posts", json={"title": "New Post", "body": "This is the content", "userId": 2})
print("POST Response:", response)
```

#### ðŸ”¹ PUT to Update Data
Updates an existing post with new title and content.
